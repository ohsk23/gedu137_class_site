        <h3>Role#1: Discussion Director</h3>As discussion director, you are the
        leader of the conversation. It is your job to make sure that each member
        plays an active role and to begin the discussion. Make 1 discussion
        topics/questions that you want to use in your group discussion. You can
        make questions related to the podcast/documentary with open-ended
        questions with no fixed answers. Make your questions starting with Who,
        What, Why, When, Where, How, or What if. Avoid questions that directly
        ask the content of the podcast/documentary or that have one answer
        and/or a simple answer. Be sure to allow others to answer the question
        before you provide your answer. At the bottom of your homework entry,
        please provide your questions and your answers.
        <h5>When you meet with your group</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Ask questions to make to your group members talk about the
            podcast/documentary.
          </li>
          <li>Ask one question a time and have all the members answer.</li>
          <li>
            After all the members have answered, provide your own. (If people
            don’t understand the question, the director’s answer can be given
            first to help others understand.)
          </li>

            Have every member participate and give each person equal chances.

        <h3>Role# 2: Connector </h3>
        <div>
          As a connector, it is your job to connect the podcast/documentary to
          real life. This is a very open activity during which you want to make
          your group members speak as much as possible. Connect the
          podcast/documentary with your experience and others' life experience.
        </div>
        <h5>Ideas for Connector role</h5>
        <div>
          <li>Your own past experiences </li>
          <li>Happenings at school or in the community</li>
          <li>Stories in the news Similar events at other times and places</li>
          <li>Other people or problems that you are reminded of</li>
        </div>
        <div>
          If you have similar experience or know others that do, connect them
          with the podcast/documentary. Provide your questions at the bottom of
          your homework entry and answer your own questions. The main goal of
          this role is to get the members of your group to speak at length about
          a particular topic. Therefore, yes/no questions are not appropriate
          here. Try to get your group members to talk about their opinions, past
          experiences, hopes, or hypothetical situations (What would you do
          if…?).
        </div>
        <h5>When you meet with your group</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Tell your members the content of the podcast/documentary you want to
            connect.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tell them how the content is related to your own/other's experience,
            or connect it to something related to real life? What are the
            similarities?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask your members if they have a similar experience or know of
            someone who does.

        <h3>Role #3: Vocabulary Wizard/ Passage Picker</h3>
        <h5>Role: Vocabulary Wizard</h5>
        <div>
          In any podcast/documentary there are words and expressions that may be
          difficult to understand. Your job is to find any words or expressions
          and inform your group what they mean. Look up the definition in the
          dictionary and provide your group members with a correct definition of
          the word. Also, when discussing vocabulary, you should always refer
          back to the podcast/documentary in order to examine the word in
          context. Please show your group members where in the
          podcast/documentary you found the word. As the vocabulary wizard, you
          must also make up 2 interesting discussion questions using both of the
          words that you have found.
        </div>
        <h5>

            found (one or two sentences)
          </li>
          <li>

            questions that you have made up. The discussion questions that you
            have made up.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Role: Passage Picker</h5>
        <div>
          Locate a few special sections or quotations in the podcast/documentary
          for your group to talk over. It can be a short/long sentence. The idea
          is to help group members go back to some especially interesting,
          powerful, funny, strange or important sections of the
          podcast/documentary and think about them more carefully. The passage
          picker selects and then leads a discussion about the selected passage.
          Usually the passage picker will ask other group members about how they
          feel about the chosen text. Make up 1 discussion question for your
          group.
        </div>
        <h5>When you upload the Passage Picker role to Turnitin you should</h5>
